    "\n",
    "### A program to simulate random walks.\n",
    "\n",
    "A particle is positioned at each of the (x, y) coordinates of a N x N lattice grid.\n",
    "M simualtions are carried out to determine the probability of each particle reaching\n",
    "the bottom boundary of the grid during a random walk of up to S steps.\n",
    "\n",
    "This is a compute bound problem, as there is no data shared between simulations.\n",
    "The result of each simualtion is independent and the result is success (if the bottom\n",
    "boundary is reached) or failure (if any other boundary is reached, or S steps are\n",
    "completed without a boundary being reached). A data structure is used to count the\n",
    "number of successes, which is subsequently turned into a probability.\n",
    "\n",
    "This is an integer problem. The random walks are implemented as a single integer\n",
    "step up, down, left or right. And the success counts are integer. Therefore, to avoid\n",
    "floating point overhead, as much as possible is done using integer data\n",
    "structures (which also results in a memory saving) and integer operations. A floating\n",
    "point data sructure is used at the end of the program to store the probabilties.\n",
    "\n",
    "Numpy arrays are used at the outset as the data structure to store the random walk\n",
    "success counts (an integer array) and the resulting probabilities (a float array). \n",
    "Matplotlib is then used to display the probabilities.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Program Structure Optimisation\n",
    "\n",
    "Because this is a compute bound problem, the structure of the program was consisdered\n",
    "carefully to ensure function calls and repeated operations are minimised. Function calls\n",
    "considered likely to be expensive are done once outside of a loop rather than multiple\n",
    "times inside a loop.\n",
    "\n",
